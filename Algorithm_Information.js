**Difference between Searching and Sorting Algorithm:

1.	Searching Algorithms are designed to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is used.	
    A Sorting Algorithm is used to arranging the data of list or array into some specific order.
2.	These algorithms are generally classified into two categories i.e. Sequential Search and Interval Search.	
    There are two different categories in sorting. These are Internal and External Sorting.
3.	The worst-case time complexity of searching algorithm is O(N).	
    The worst-case time complexity of many sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort is O(N2).
4.	There is no stable and unstable searching algorithms.	
    Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc are the stable sorting algorithms whereas Quick Sort, Heap Sort etc are the unstable sorting algorithms.
5.	The Linear Search and the Binary Search are the examples of Searching Algorithms.	
    The Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort etc are the examples of Sorting Algorithms.
